# _Beep Boop_

#### _Attempts to generate a number range and replace certain numbers with "beeps" and "boops", August 17th 2018_

#### By _**Miles Bradt**_

## Description

_Place a number and keep clicking to generate an array to increment by one until your number is reached. Each "0" or "1" will be replaced with a "beep" and "boop" (not working as intended yet)_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Open index.html_
* _Open through gh-pages link: https://milesbradt.github.io/beep_boop/_

## Spec objectives (least important to most important)

* _increments that contain a 0 are replaced (all digits) with "Beep!"_
* _increments that contain a 1 are replaced (all digits) with "Boop!"_
* _increments divisible by 3 are replaced with "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."_

## Known Bugs

* _Spec requirement replacing full digits in a number with "beep" or "boop" does not work, only does each "0" or "1" displayed._

* _Final spec just straight up doesn't work_

* _Instead of the full array being incremented by one appearing at once, the user has to enter again for each increment_
